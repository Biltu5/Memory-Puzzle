# Memory-Puzzle
## Idea
Memory puzzle is a great game to enhance your concentration power and improve your memory.  
At the starting of the game, the shapes are displayed for a second and then they are covered.  
One by one user selects the tile to uncover and when two similar shapes are uncovered the score <br/>
gets increased.  This way we have to uncover all the pairs of shapes.
